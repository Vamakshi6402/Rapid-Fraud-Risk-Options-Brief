## 📝 Overview  
This repository presents an **independently developed rapid-options brief** outlining **rule-based fraud controls**, **minimum viable safeguards**, **KPI structures**, and **deployment pathways** for strengthening fraud-resilience in **public finance and government payment systems**.

The brief demonstrates applied economist capabilities in **risk modeling**, **governance design**, and **operational control structures**, with a focus on rapid implementation, scalability, and data-lite execution.

📘 **[Click to view PDF](docs/RapidOptionsBrief_VamakshiChaturvedi.pdf)**

A concise options brief covering:  
- **Fraud risk categories** and high-frequency abuse patterns  
- **Rule-based control logic** for immediate fraud suppression  
- **Minimum viable safeguards** for rapid deployment  
- **KPI and dashboard metrics** for system-level monitoring  
- **Governance & rollout pathways** tailored for resource-constrained public finance contexts  
- **Operational decision points** requiring policy alignment  

This deliverable demonstrates frameworks, logic pathways, and decision structures used in the **design of fraud-control systems** and **public financial management mechanisms**.

## 🎯 Analytical Focus Areas  
- **Fraud Detection & Risk Categorization**  
- **Rule-Based Controls & Threshold Logic**  
- **Minimum Viable Safeguards (MVS)**  
- **KPI Architecture & Monitoring Metrics**  
- **Public Finance Systems**  
- **Governance Design & Implementation Pathways**  

These areas reflect core competencies in **risk modeling**, **policy evaluation**, and **controls design**, aligning with economist roles in **payments**, **abuse prevention**, and **financial operations**.

## 🌍 Context & Purpose  
This work was prepared as part of my **independent applied research portfolio**, exploring practical, rapid-deployment mechanisms for reducing fraud exposure in **public finance workflows**.

It reflects **independent analytical capability**, the ability to **design control systems from scratch**, and applied understanding of how **risk logic, KPIs, and governance structures** support safe, scalable financial programs.  

These competencies map directly onto economists' work in **risk analysis**, **policy design**, **operational controls**, and **public-sector financial systems**.
